## Description: 

Our site is a full-service application for a Mexican restaurant. A user can view the menu, place an order including payment, send a message to us, view our story, and find our store location and hours. The application was made using Javascript, GraphQL, MongoDB, JWT, and React. We also used Twilio Sendgrid to allow contact information to be sent to an employee via email.
