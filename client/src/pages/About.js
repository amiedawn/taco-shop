        From our family to yours, Full Stack Taco Shop dares to whisk you away to the streets of Mexico through the
        smells and taste of our authentic cuisine. Using only recipes handed down for generations, we delight in serving
        our customers with only the finest, freshest ingredients. Abuela Maria still comes in on weekends to help
        prepare her special guacamole.It was she who first started this idea of sharing her talents in the kitchen with
        others. Now forty-eight years later, the legacy lives on.

        what we know will be the best Mexican dishes in town! Try our signature tacos, oversized burritos, satisfying
